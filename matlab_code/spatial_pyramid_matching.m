function single_descriptor = spatial_pyramid_matching(feature_descriptors, dictionary)
% SPATIAL_PYRAMID_MATCHING
    % Steps:
    
    % divide the image into 3 spatial scales (whole image, 4 sections, 16
    % sections
    
    % get responses of dictionary to feature descriptors of each section
    
    % perform max pooling on the responses
    
    % concatenate / combine results into a single feature descriptor
end
